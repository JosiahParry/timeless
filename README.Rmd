<!-- badges: end -->

A fast general purpose date/time converter using the Rust crate [dateparser](https://crates.io/crates/dateparser) and [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono).

## Installation

You can install the development version of chronos like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("schochastics/chronos")
#or
pak::pak("schochastics/chronos")
```

```{r}
library(chronos)
```

## Formats

chronos understands 93 different date(time) formats out of the box
```{r}
bench_date
```
plus all formats supported by [anytime](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime).

`chronos()` parses each date(time) into a character with a form that can be easily
transformed into a `date` or `POSIXct` object by any standard datetime R function.
(**This will eventually be included in chronos**) 
```{r}
chronos(bench_date)
```


# other packages

[anytime](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime) is the most accepted general purpose date(time) converter.

It does not recognize all accepted formats of chronos out of the box
```{r}
dplyr::coalesce(
    anytime::anytime(bench_date),
    anytime::anydate(bench_date)
)
```

The list of formats supported out-of-the-box can be retrieved with `anytime::getFormats()`.
`chronos` implements these formats natively too.

Concerning runtime, `chronos` seems to be quite a bit faster than `anytime`.
```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    chronos(bench_date),
    anytime::anytime(bench_date)
)
```

Note however that chronos does return only a character vector that needs to be converted
to a `POSIXct`. This could be done efficiently with [fasttime](https://github.com/s-u/fasttime) 

**Disclaimer**:  
While it might seem that `chronos` has an edge over `anytime`, it is far less battle tested and
robust. I am grateul for everyone who can take the package for a spin and report issues.
