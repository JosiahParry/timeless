Parse strings with arbitrary dates into datetime objects using the Rust crate [dateparser](https://crates.io/crates/dateparser).

## Installation

You can install the development version of chronos like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("schochastics/chronos")
#or
pak::pak("schochastics/chronos")
```

```{r}
library(chronos)
```

## Formats

chronos understands 97 different date(time) formats.
```{r}
bench_date
```

`chronos()` parses each date into a character with a form that can be easily
transformed into a `date` or `POSIXct` object by any standard datetime R package. 
```{r}
chronos(bench_date)
```


# other packages

[anytime](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime) is the most accepted general purpose date(time) converter.

While it does not recognize all accepted formats of chronos out of the box
```{r}
dplyr::coalesce(
    anytime::anytime(bench_date),
    anytime::anydate(bench_date)
)
```

It does recognize other formats that chronos does not.
```{r}
anytime::anydate("20240224")
chronos("20240224")
```

`chronos` is quite a bit faster though.
```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    chronos(bench_date),
    anytime::anytime(bench_date)
)
```
